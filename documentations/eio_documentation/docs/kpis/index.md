# Background

Autodesk strives to be a data driven organization however repeatedly tell conflicting data stories​.

There are many KPIs across different business units that are calculated differently and leverage different data sources​. Sources for dimensions are inconsistent and often there is no single source of truth. We often ask to define a customer and rarely understand it many data entities and how they should be traversed and reported on. 

This all leads to long lead time to complete analysis and develop insights, the focus being focus on simple metrics and assumptions.


# Goal

We would like business leaders to have easy access to analytics and insights that will support their day to day; goal setting, tracking progress and making decisions. Our representatives will have relevant and impactful conversations with customers by using targeted and reliable insights. The above will be driven by analyst communities across the COO organization and beyond into the wider Autodesk, highly versed in Autodesk data, with access to knowledge, data and with support from subject matter experts.

In order to support data driven organizations in Autodesk, we need to host accessible, explainable and centralized data domains, metrics, dimensions and customer concepts. We need to create a knowledge and best practices hub that will enable fast adoption and consistent reporting. Building foundations is the best way to enable innovation and support sustainable processes.

# Proposal
In order to achieve our goal we will work across 3 key pillars: 

    - KPI standardisation
        - Prioritise key metrics in COO organisation
        - Collect use cases, build source data where needed
        - Set best practices and roll them across data community.

    - Reporting best practices
        - Set best practices and knowledge library for 
            - 40+ key dimensions used in COO organisation
            - multiple customer identities (parent, child, opportunity, user...) 
            - Easy traversing across customer identities
        - Roll out across data community.

    -Innovation
        - Design metrics to look at our customers through new lens.
        - Create and implement new dimensions to enable use case specific cohorting.

Each of those will be achieved by : 

    - Use cases gathering and cooperation between business, data and engineering communities
    - Set standards and improve source data.
    - Timely, relevant and extensive documentation on all items.​
    - Workshops and 1-1 support in transitioning to new practices.
    - Pre-release datasets created in EIO layer by EAX team.
    - Production datasets created in EDH out of EAX requirements.
