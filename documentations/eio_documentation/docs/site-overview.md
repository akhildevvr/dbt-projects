Welcome to the **Customer Analytics Technical Documentation** site.

The purpose of this site is to bring to one location documentation and other resources to help you understand how to access and use analytics data that describes Autodesk customers.

## Why is this important

It is primarily about **understanding our customers**.   We are interested in understanding how our customers are purchasing software, how they are using it, and how are customers are being supported by the various programs and initiatives Autodesk runs to support them.


## The Challenge
Data at Autodesk is messy.   

What an opening statement, but it is one that any employee of Autodesk who accesses data will be very familiar with.   The fact that data is messy is often used as an excuse as to why it is difficult to generate insights.  Most employees struggle to describe how business concepts and datasets fit together. Years of rapid growth, business model evolutions and an ethos of move fast and break stuff have resulted in a data landscape that few understand how to connect and even fewer know how to describe. 

!!! success
    Let's change that.
