## :material-chart-bar:{.red-icon-heading} Introduction

ACV (Annual Contract Value) represents the annualized contract value of billing transactions based on settlement start and end dates, ranging from Net 0 to Net 4.

The purpose of this metric is to provide a normalized view of the contract value to a single year and is especially useful in comparing contracts with different term lengths (an annual vs. 3-year contract, for example). The breakdown from "Net 0" to "Net 4" indicates which promotions and discounts are included in the particular ACV calculation, and enables discussions of price realization throughout the selected period.

The Annual Contract Value metric can be used to obtain information about the performance of a yearly price strategy by taking into account different contract billings, discounts, geographical locations, and date ranges. It is also possible to filter the data by industry and to compare the result between customers in order to receive a more accurate report.


## :material-database-settings:{ .purple-icon-heading } Metric details

### Overview
    
#### What does this metric measure?

ACV measures the annualized contract value and contains 3 main components: **Contract Value**, **Annualization** and **Currency Conversion**, using the logic as following:

1. **Contract Value** 
Based on `Net{n}` billings from Finmart, where `n` ranges from 0 to 4 to consider the below pricing waterfall:

    - Net 0 ACV measures represent variations of the 'SRP Billed'.
    - Net 1 ACV measures represent variations of the 'SRP billed less Promo/Bundle'.
    - Net 2 ACV measures represent variations of the 'Discounted SRP'
    - Net 3 ACV measures represent variations of the 'Total Billed'.
    - Net 4 ACV measures represent variations of the 'Total Billed After Backend Discount'.

2. **Annualization** 
This allows us to normalize the total value of the contract to a single year and is especially useful in comparing contracts with different term lengths (an annual vs. 3-year contract, for example)
Conceptually, what we're trying to do through annualization is take a multi-year contract and divide the contract value across each of those years. For example, if a 3-year contract has a Net 3 contract value of $3000, then the Net 3 ACV would be $3000 / 3 years = $1000.

3. **Currency Conversion** 
The last step in constructing the ACV within `FinMart` is to convert the ACV from the foreign currency into USD in order to minimize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations over the course of the year. To do this, FinMart uses constant currencies (denoted by `cc` in FinMart fields). Autodesk sets a single exchange rate once per year for each currency.

### Calculation

Sum of a `CC_FBM_TOTAL_ACV_NET0_USD` field (with `NET0` used as an example) in a particular transaction date.

#### Metric granularity

ACV is available at a **date** and **transaction** level (or `src_id` in `CVC_FINMART`). It can be rolled up to the order number (`sales_order_number`) and order line item (`sales_order_line_nbr`) level. It can also be easily rolled up to any dimension available in Finmart, including child and parent account CSN.


### Caveats & clarifications

??? info "Specifications"
    #### 1. Data availability

    - Data is limited to products pushed into Finmart so some acquisition data may not be included (e.g., Innovyze).
    - The `cvc_finmart` table only contains transactional data while Barcelona Dashboard also contains manual entries such as SAP Journal Entries, which are adjustments made by the Revenue Accounting team, these could be billings from acquired companies that were not yet incorporated into our systems, and MDS Interface which are adjustments to transactions that were made incorrectly and could not be corrected due to occasions such as a quarter end, so the adjustments are made via such data entries.

    #### 2. Currency Standardization

    - Autodesk has a variety of billing types corresponding to various discounts included in the price (Net0-Net4). AOV is typically counted at the Net3 or Net4 level - it's important to be clear which level the metric is calculated at when presenting analysis. 
    - Similarly, Finmart lists billings in both Constant Currency (CC) and US Dollars (USD). Curated Finmart provides AOV using the CC ACV values, but it is equally valid to calculate using USD - be sure to clarify which is being used when calculating this KPI.

#### Data quality checks & reports

!!! warning "Known Issues"

    1. Data Quality Checks
    The fields representing ACV NET2 USD, ACV NET3 USD and ACV NET4 USD from CVC_FINMART were checked against Barcelona Dashboard and the variance identified is below 0.001% for every quarter since FY2020.

    2. To achieve the same numbers the Barcelona Dashboard had to be filtered to select only "Invoices" from Document Category dimension.
