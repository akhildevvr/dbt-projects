## :fontawesome-solid-magnifying-glass-chart: Introduction

This article provides a overview of the changes made to the Salesforce Opportunity table through Apollo's 2.1.2 release and how these changes impact the underlying business. The article is structured to provide the federated analytical community with a summary of the changes made to the table, and discuss possible uses and outline potential business impacts or tactical challenges for analysts introduced by these changes.

## :material-book-search: Background

Opportunities are potential selling events for new and renewal business. They represent the chance for the enterprise to sell a product or service to an existing or potential customer. Opportunities play an important role in sales pipeline management and prioritization. They are assigned stages to describe their progression from prospect to qualification to solution-building to proposal/negotiation, and finally to closing. The goal of a sales opportunity is to covert the opportunity into a sale, which helps the business grow and generate revenue.

The following conceptual data model is provided to describe Opportunities: 

<figure markdown>
  ![Opportunities conceptual data model](../assets/opportunities-conceptual-data-model.png)
</figure>

Shown above: One account can have many opportunities. One purchaser (stored in the data as a primary contact) is assigned per Opportunity. Opportunities can have many opportunity line items attached. Not shown: Opportunities can only link to one lead, one owner, one partner. Opportunities can link to more than one order which are at the opportunity line item level.  Opportunities can (and do) link to multiple other opportunities. They often link to multiple subscriptions, service contracts, contract line items, assets, and quotes. NxM simplifies many of the service contract and subscription elements. [The impact assessment for service contract and contract line item changes is here](https://wiki.autodesk.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=1878601085).

### Opportunities & Renewal Business (AIR/ROM Transition to 'Subscription Opportunities')

Pre-NxM (Pre [New Transaction Model](https://wiki.autodesk.com/display/BMP/New+Transaction+Model+Business+Policy+Workstream)) there are two types of renewals assignable to opportunities: AIR and ROM renewals. AIR (Autodesk Internal Renewals) opportunities are used mainly by the commercial customer success team as a pipeline management object and to track customer success advisor, renewal executive and customer success activities like human-to-human emails and phone calls. ROM (Renewal Opportunity Management) opportunities are used to manage the transactive elements of renewal conversions like auto-triggered emails and updates to salesforce as customers progress through renewal workflows. AIR Opportunities are assigned to customer success advisors and renewal executives. ROMs are not. Both can link to the same contract line item and they often offer similar yet different records of the same renewal event. (More detail about ROMs and AIRs [are available here](https://wiki.autodesk.com/display/CDA/AIR+Opportunity+vs.+ROM+Opportunity+Reconciliation).)

In Q3 FY24, AIR and ROM opportunities will transition to 'Subscription Opportunities' for any eligible NxM Single User Subscription (SUS) renewal based on the timeline dictated by their country of origin's [NxM GTM (go-to-market) country go-live date](https://wiki.autodesk.com/display/BMP/NxM+Eligible+Countries+and+Rollout+Timing). The first country to adopt this will be Australia in November, 2023. North America will follow with a target of May. EMEA in August. Then, Japan in the second half of the year. To align with Apollo and NxM (Next Generation Model) business requirements [Salesforce made changes](https://wiki.autodesk.com/display/DPED/SFDC+Data+Model+updates) to its [Opportunity model](https://wiki.autodesk.com/display/DBP/Opportunity+Data+Model+for+R2.1.2) to consolidate AIR and ROM renewals. A summary of these changes and their NXM business context are provided in the next section.

## :material-format-list-bulleted: Summary of changes

The following [business processes will be affected](https://wiki.autodesk.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=1646343177) for Agency/NxM supported countries (Australia in November):

Affected:

- **New 'Subscription Opportunities' will be based on the Offering Data Model (ODM)**
- **Renewal Opportunities (AIR & ROM) will transition on a rolling basis as they come up for renewal**
    - Renewal Opportunities (ROM) will no longer exist for Renewal processing (AUTO RENEW OFF scenarios).
    - Agents will use Subscription data and Subscription Opportunities to manage the renewal process.
    - Autodesk Sales teams will use Subscription Opportunities to manage the renewal process. In the event of multiple Subscription Opportunities, Sales will merge them before creating quotes.

Unaffected:

- **No changes are anticipated for the Deal Discount Approval (DDA) process**. Opportunities will continue to be used for DDA approvals.

A high level summary of additions to the Opportunity and Opportunity Line Item SFDC data tables are listed below:

- **Transition Paths:** Added AIR and ROM transition paths, including fields for opportunity splits and reseller changes.
- **Opportunity Status Additions:** Added opportunity status and auto-renewal flag.
- **Sales Context Additions:** New contextual shared notes column was added for Autodesk reps and partners to share notes.
- **Join Path Consolidation:** Streamlined and consolidated join paths to other data objects, including linkages to quotes, subscriptions, parent accounts, and orders.
- **Quote, Order and Subscription Data:** Columns were added to provide detail regarding attached quotes, orders, and subscriptions. These include payment terms, payment methods, and subscription status.

## :material-table-edit: Data structure updates

This section outlines NxM specific column additions to the Opportunity and Opportunity Item tables that are of specific relevance to the November release. Note this is not a comprehensive list. It is specifically new fields to take note of to discuss NxM. 

- Opportunity
- Opportunity Line Item

### Fields added

The following is an abridged data dictionary for the fields added to the opportunity and opportunity line item tables. SFDC fields labels and definitions were derived where possible from the [sfdc data dictionary](https://wiki.autodesk.com/x/yQwVKw). Where definitions were not available or incomplete, a "proposed business definition." was created. Their statuses were listed next to their definitions. Primary source notes were included as well.

### General Use Code

The following are sql examples are provided to assist navigating opportunity data within salesforce.

??? abstract "Snowflake sql code is built to provide basic Opportunity information"

    The following snowflake sql code is built to provide basic Opportunity information. While far from comprehensive, it consists of columns and critical joins that will be a useful baseline for many use cases. (Note, it includes some, but not all of the new columns. More exhaustive column lists are provided in subsequent examples):

### Transition Paths - Added AIR and ROM transition paths, including fields for opportunity splits and reseller changes.

Any existing Autodesk Internal Renewal Opportunity eligible to become a 'Subscription Opportunity' will have both a new Subscription Opportunity and an old, legacy AIR Opportunity. The following code provides example of Opportunities converting from old AIRs to new Subscription Opportunities:

**Opportunity Context Additions** - Many new fields were added to provide more context around the opportunity. These include next actions details, lifecycle and health status details, line item actions (new, extension, true-up, renewal, etc), compliance lock status, auto-renewal flag, and customer meeting scheduled flag. Further context is also added from fields sourced by the order and quote objects. The following example provides these fields along with several more to provide added context for most Opportunities.

## :material-text: Impact Assessment

### Productivity Impact

Changes to the Opportunity data model are anticipated to have the following impact on the analytical community within the next year: 

1. Disruption of Existing Processes: By definition, the addition of new columns will disrupt existing processes and workflows. All existing reports and dashboards that use Opportunities will be affected. Those concerned with renewal business lineage either through AIR or ROM opportunities should plan to re-architect to adopt these new join paths.
2. Additional Data Traversal Steps: With the addition of a new opportunity renewal type, there will be additional steps required to traverse the data. This could lead to increased processing time and slower analysis. It could also lead to a higher risk of errors and omissions.
3. Increased Training Requirements: With the addition of a new opportunity type, the learning curve to use the data within these tables has not been alleviated; it has expanded. Until ROM, and AIR opportunities are entirely deprecated users should assume increased time will be required to traverse the new paths provided by NxM and accommodate the old ones for countries not yet transitioned. With well over 600 columns across both tables, users unfamiliar with existing columns will require mentorship or investment in subject domain documentation - which we do not have today.

### Data Impact

#### Australia November 2023 Go-Live 

Australia will require specific monitoring prior to and after go-live. As the first country adopting NxM for single user subscription it would be prudent to proactively know the volume likely AIR and ROM renewals that will convert and monitor their progress to observe their conversion looking for patterns or differences in behavior vs prior activity.  

## :material-text-short: Conclusion

In Q3 FY24, AIR and ROM opportunities will transition into NxM SUS Subscriptions based on the timeline dictated by their NxM GTM (go-to-market) country go-live date. Salesforce has made changes to its Opportunity model to consolidate these overlapping concepts, to align with Apollo and NxM (Next Generation Model) business requirements. Critical join fields were added to connect NxM Subscription opportunities to their order, go-to-market hierarchy, quote line item, subscription, split opportunities, and transitioned opportunities. Select data was added as well for both subscription single user and Flex opportunities that include tokens, discount amounts, payment methods and sales representative notes. The addition of these new columns will disrupt existing processes and workflows. All existing reports and dashboards that use Opportunities will be affected. Those concerned with renewal business lineage either through AIR or ROM opportunities should plan to re-architect to adopt these new join paths. This could lead to increased processing time and slower analysis. It could also lead to a higher risk of errors and omissions. Until ROM, and AIR opportunities are entirely deprecated users should assume increased time will be required to traverse the new paths provided by NxM and accommodate the old ones for countries not yet transitioned. With well over 600 columns across both tables, users unfamiliar with existing columns will require mentorship or investment in subject domain documentation to enable successful adoption and application.
