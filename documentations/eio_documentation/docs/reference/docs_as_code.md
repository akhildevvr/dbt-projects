# Docs-as-code
This site uses an approach known as *docs-as-code* which is a fast evolving concept for creating and maintaining technical documentation.   Many organisations are already adopting the concept, however it is not yet widely adopted inside Autodesk.   

The concept is to use the same tools that are widely adopted by technical teams to develop and maintain their technical documentation alongside the code that is being developed to support their products.   In the context of GRO-EDA the main product focuses are:

    - KPI Definitions
    - Enterprise Data
    - Data Scicene Models
    - Experimentation (A/B testing)
    - Adovocacy and Documentation

The technical documentation that is necessary to support either the direct adoption of the above, or the adoption of insights derived from the above makes this a great candidtate to leverage the concept.

## Concepts
The main concepts associated to â€¢docs-as-code* is the following:

    - Tools used to develop and maintain the docs are the same as used for all other work
    - Documents are created in plain text using simple text editors (e.g. VSCode)
    - Documents are version managed in Git
    - Documents can be reviewed (similar as code reviews before merging)
    - Documents are released in parallel to the products they are describing.

## Benefits
The general benefits of this approach can be summarized as:

    - Technical Writers can easily integrated into the analytics engineering and data science teams
    - Analysts, Data Engineers and Data Scientists can write a first draft of the documents
    - You can block merging of new product features until the documentation is ready to be released
    - You can easily manage the look and feel of the product documentation so it has a consistent 'brand'

## References
There are many examples of organization using this approach to maintain their technical documentation.  

Some notable examples are:
